### Fundamental Data Structures

1. Array: A collection of elements identified by index or key.
2. Linked List: A linear collection of data elements where each element points to the next.
3. Stack: A collection of elements that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
4. Queue: A collection of elements that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.
5. Hash Table: A data structure that maps keys to values for fast access.
6. Tree: A hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, with a root node and child nodes.
7. Binary Tree: A tree data structure in which each node has at most two children.
8. Binary Search Tree (BST): A binary tree where the left child is less than the parent and the right child is greater.
9. Heap: A complete binary tree where each node satisfies the heap property.
10. Graph: A collection of nodes connected by edges, used to represent relationships.



### Essential Algorithms

1. Sorting Algorithms: Techniques to arrange elements in a specific order (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort).
2. Searching Algorithms: Methods to find an element in a data structure (e.g., Binary Search, Linear Search).
3. Dynamic Programming: A method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.
4. Greedy Algorithms: Algorithms that make the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.
5. Backtracking: A recursive algorithm for solving problems incrementally, removing solutions that fail to satisfy constraints.
6. Graph Algorithms: Techniques for traversing and analyzing graphs (e.g., Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm).
