### STACK

Stack is a linear data structure.
We can perform operations like - Insert, delete.
Insert is called push
Delete is called pop
Insertion and deletion can be performed only in one direction.
Stack is a collection of similar datatypes
Stack can be implemented in 2 ways. 1. Lists (static memory) 2. LinkedList (Dynamic memory)

### Operations

There are 3 operations.
1. push(x) - pushes the element into the stack.
2. pop() - removes and returns the element from the top, which is last element that got inserted.
3. peek() / top() - it returns the top most element from the stack without removing it.
4. isempty() - it returns true if the stack is empty else false
5. isfull() - it returns true if the stack is full else false

### Applications

1. Reverse a string
2. Undo mechanism
3. Recursion / function call - last in first out
4. Balancing of parenthesis - this check is also done using the concept of stack.
5. Infix to Prefix / Postfix
